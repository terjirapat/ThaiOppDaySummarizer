      "\t+ DCC is a Thai ceramic products manufacturer with a dividend yield of around 5%.\n",
      "\t+ The company has plans to expand its business globally.\n",
      "\t+ Company's main products are mass medium and medium-to-high-end products, with 70% of revenue coming from mass medium.\n",
      "\t+ Company has a significant presence in the northern and northeastern regions, with 35% of revenue coming from these areas.\n",
      "\t+ EBITDA and profit for the period have been increasing, with a slight dip in Q1.\n",
      "\t+ Dividend payout ratio has increased from 53% to 95%, indicating a high level of payout.\n",
      "\t+ Company's financials show an increase in net debt from around 80% to 50%, indicating a decrease in leverage.\n",
      "\t+ ROE and ROA have improved, indicating a higher return on equity and assets.\n",
      "* **[Idea]**:\n",
      "\t+ The company's value lies in its low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and dividend yield, making it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking for long-term growth.\n",
      "\t+ The CEO may be trying to increase the proportion of high-end products in their portfolio.\n",
      "\t+ The company may be trying to maintain a high level of payouts to shareholders, potentially to support the stock price.\n",

      "\t+ \"We're not following the same old path... We want to make it bigger and better.\"\n",
      "\t+ \"ROE มันมาจาก returnonequity แต่ว่า ROA มันมาจาก returnonasset อ่ะ\" (ROE comes from return on equity, while ROA comes from return on asset)\n",
      "\t+ \"ถ้าเกิด ROA กับ ROE มันต่างกันมาก เนี่ยแปลว่ามันค่อนข้างเยอะ เพราะว่า equity เนี่ยมันเพราะว่า asset เนี่ยมันมาจาก equity คูณตัวหนี้สิน บวกกับต้าหนี้สิน นะครับ\" (If ROA and ROE are significantly different, it means that the company's equity is being used to finance its assets, which could indicate a high level of risk)\n",
